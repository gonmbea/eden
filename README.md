# Meu Éden

Meu Éden is my first personal portfolio, a React and Sass project that combines my artwork with web development.  
All icons and illustrations are based on my own sketches, digitized to create a distinctive visual style.  

## Features
- Custom hand-drawn illustrations and icons  
- Minimal and organic visuals inspired by sketchbooks and nature  
- Fully responsive layout  

## Live Demo

## Notes
Please, please ignore the failing pipeline. This just isn't my priority anymore :)
